## Quick Start

### System Requirements
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- Internet connection (for translation service)
- Audio output device (for capturing system audio)

### Usage Steps
1. Extract the downloaded zip file to any directory
2. Double-click `SLAPSMeetingCapsule.exe` to run
3. Select the correct audio device from the dropdown (usually "Stereo Mix" or devices with "Loopback")
4. Click [▶ Start] button
5. Play the audio/video you want to translate
6. View real-time translation results
7. (Optional) Place meeting-related documents in the `meeting_docs` folder, restart program to load
8. Click [💡 Hints] button to enable smart hints, get document-based contextual hints, conversational response suggestions and translation subtitles

### Audio Device Selection Guide
- **Stereo Mix**: Most recommended, supported by most sound cards
- **[Loopback] devices**: Virtual audio devices, try each if multiple exist
- **What U Hear**: Creative sound card specific
- ⚠️ Avoid selecting "Microphone" devices

## Features

### Real-time Translation
- Based on OpenAI Whisper offline speech recognition
- Uses Google Translate API (free version)
- Supports continuous audio stream processing
- Automatic sentence breaking with intelligent segmentation

### Smart Hint System
- Scans documents in `meeting_docs` folder
- Supported formats: .txt, .md, .yaml
- Matches relevant knowledge based on current conversation
- Provides context-aware hint information

### Conversational Response Suggestions
When questions are detected, the system provides:
- Brief conversational response templates
- Context-based reply suggestions
- Helps you organize language quickly

### Auto Sync Feature

When processing speed cannot keep up with audio input, the system accumulates delay. The Auto Sync feature intelligently manages this delay, balancing between real-time performance and content completeness.

#### How It Works
- **When OFF**: Preserves all audio content but may accumulate delay
- **When ON**: Automatically drops old audio when delay exceeds threshold, maintaining real-time sync

#### Usage Recommendations
- **Formal meetings/Webinars**: Enable Auto Sync to keep up with the pace
- **Friend chats/Group discussions**: Disable Auto Sync, ask speaker to slow down if needed
- **Watching videos/Live streams**: Enable Auto Sync to maintain audio-video synchronization

#### Parameter Adjustment
Edit the `auto_sync` section in `config.yaml` to adjust:
- `trigger_delay`: Delay threshold to trigger auto-drop (default: 2s)
- `target_retain`: Audio duration to retain (default: 1.5s)
- `warning_delay`: Delay threshold for warning display (default: 5s)

#### Status Indicators
- Orange button = Auto Sync enabled
- Blue button = Auto Sync disabled
- System will display appropriate status messages
